A Bare-Minimum User Task Scheduler Implementated in C++11 Win32 CLI.

## Notice

You are looking at this branch that contains the old code that I used to present in my project. For the latest branch, please switch to the latest default branch.

The code in this repository may not work since the repository directory has been changed. Meaning, some paths declared in VSC++ project settings have their paths untangled with the paths I have in the local disk. **The use of this project at this state must be taken with discretion**.
