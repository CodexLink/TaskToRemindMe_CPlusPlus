# `Win32`ConsoleReminder

A Task Reminder App in Console, written in Pure MSVC++ Win32.

## Notice

Keep note that the development of this project will be slow since there are other projects that I need to do. Plus, no one might use it.

Since this is just my personal project, I would just do it either way because why not?

## Development

There will be transparency such as the flow of the program: This [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N99xZ8FM-DcjDjFV-6rL9CSXidMK_1qM/view?usp=sharing) will redirect you to diagrams.net or just a preview of the flow file.
